## Steps
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MaxPuig/spotify-to-yt-download.git`
2. Install libraries: `npm install`
3. Modify `1_index.js`'s `config` variable with your Spotify `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `playlistId`
4. Run the scripts in order
   1. `node 1_index.js` - Search for the Spotify songs on YouTube Music.
   2. `node 2_compareAlbumCover.js` - Compare the Spotify and YouTube Music album covers and playtime. Modify the `percentage` variable to change the threshold for the album cover similarity.
   3. `node 3_checkIfSame.js` - (Recommended/Optional) Open http://localhost:1234/ and choose if the songs match. This step is optional if you trust the previous step, you won't download the songs that didn't match the album cover or the difference between song duration was >2.
   4. `node 4_searchUnconfirmed.js` - (Optional) Open http://localhost:1234/ and choose an alternative YouTube video/song. This step is optional if you don't want to search for an alternative song from the "different" songs from the previous step.
   5. `node 5_yt2mp3.js` - Download the songs to the `./songs` folder.
5. Enjoy your songs in the `./songs` folder!
